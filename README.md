# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Set up with `git clone` and `npm install`
Copy the web url repo and run `git clone` with it to clone our project's scripts.

Make sure npm is installed by running `npm install`.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

#### How to use DailyZen Anonymously
By default when launching the application with npm start, users would be directed to the home page. On the home page, users has four different options of challenges they
can select from. The options are mood, journaling, gratitude, and yoga. To complete the challenges simply click on their buttons which would navigate to a new page with
instructions to follow to complete the challenge. After following the instructions of the challenges and users feel satisfied, click the finish button to conclude their
daily challenge run. Users are allowed to navigate to the community and settings tab but have limited access to these features. In order to have access to these features,
users must sign in.

#### How to use DailyZen With an Account
With the same launching process of being an anonymous user, users have two different ways to sign in. There are two different ways to sign in which are to click on the
incognito avatar that says sign in and in the settings tab. Users can sign in with the account username "billy" and password "billy". Once users have signed in, they are
allowed to have these additional features of adding friends, seeing the community tab, navigating to friends' profiles, the option to share their thoughts on their
completed challenge, and changing any adjustments in the settings tab.

To add friends, users navigate to the community tab, click on add friends button, and accept any incoming friend requests with the green check mark button. They also have
the option to friend request other users as well by clicking on the add button under the search bar searching for a user. Once done adding friends, navigate to back
to the community tab with the back button. The community page is updated to share posts from those users. To look at another user's profile, click on their username. Users
have the ability to unfriend other users by clicking on the unfriend button on their profile page or going to the home page and clicking on a user's profile icon under the
recent activities from friends section. If users want to make any changes to their account they can navigate to the settings page and have the ability to change account
information, notifications, manage their friends, log out, and delete their account.
